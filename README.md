## Overview

This repository contains a web application built with Streamlit for predicting the potability of water based on various water quality parameters. It utilizes a machine learning model to provide users with insights into the safety of drinking water.

### Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting water quality parameters.
- Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., VotingClassifier) to make predictions.
- Displays the prediction result, indicating whether the water is potable or not.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main Streamlit app script.
- `model/`: Directory for saving machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-potability-prediction.git
