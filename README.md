## Overview

This repository contains a web application built with Streamlit for predicting the potability of water based on various water quality parameters. It utilizes a machine learning model to provide users with insights into the safety of drinking water.

### Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting water quality parameters.
- Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., VotingClassifier) to make predictions.
- Displays the prediction result, indicating whether the water is potable or not.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main Streamlit app script.
- `model/`: Directory for saving machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project information.

## Usage

1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Input water quality parameters such as turbidity, hardness, pH, etc.
3. Click the "Predict Potability" button to receive a prediction.
4. The app will display whether the water is potable or not.

## Model Compatibility

The project includes support for ensemble models like VotingClassifier. It provides guidance on how to save and load such models to ensure proper functionality.
